Instead, their slightly higher support for government intervention can be largely explained by their socioeconomic vulnerabilities, leftist political views, and perceptions of social conditions. The study also finds that immigrants’ preferences for welfare redistribution acculturate to the mainstream views of the native population in their host countries, particularly among second-generation immigrants. This suggests that concerns over immigrants disproportionately burdening the welfare system may be overestimated, as their attitudes toward welfare provision align closely with those of natives."

It discusses the influence of welfare state design on public attitudes, finding little support for political trust affecting these views. Differences in financial cheating attitudes were less clear, with no significant cultural effects on civic morality identified.

It finds a significant relationship between the preferences for redistribution in an immigrant's country of birth and their personal preferences in their new country of residence. This relationship is robust even when controlling for economic factors and is further evidenced through voting behaviors.

The research reveals that the conventional approach of family-based class assignment explains more variation than individual-based approaches. Significant cross-country differences are noted, with female employment influences being strongest in Germany, followed by Sweden, and negligible in the US. The study challenges traditional class theory by emphasizing the role of female employment and institutional influences on socio-political orientations."

Absolute stagnation (low personal income growth) tends to reduce support for redistribution  whereas relative stagnation (low income growth compared to others) increases support.

Interaction effects also show that the impact of income stagnation varies with the individuals’ relative and absolute income positions."

It finds that subjects with spiteful preferences react most strongly to competitive pressure and perform best under competitive conditions.

It finds substantial variation in fee schedules and redistribution levels, which do not correspond directly to pre-tax income distributions but are influenced by local policy-makers' characteristics and preferences.

It found that individuals' socioeconomic status and their neighborhood deprivation levels affect their support for redistribution.

The majority of respondents favor more progressive tax structures but deem overall tax levels too high. The influence of individual characteristics on tax preferences shows that low-income and low-trust individuals prefer more progressive taxes, whereas middle-income groups, the better educated, and public employees are more supportive of higher tax levels."

Despite economic disparities informal workers are not significantly more inclined towards state redistribution than formal workers. Education level significantly influences informal workers' redistribution preferences suggesting a nuanced interplay of economic self-interest and long-term insurance needs. The lack of a pronounced insider-outsider divide on redistribution challenges classical economic theories and highlights the complexity of socio-economic cleavages in the region."

It finds that while information increases concern about inequality, it does not change tax preferences unless combined with mobilization that alters beliefs about the feasibility of reducing inequality. Mobilization effects were significant, suggesting that changing perceptions about the feasibility of reducing inequality can influence tax preferences.

It finds that when wage inequality is high, there is less support for redistribution if incomes are believed to be based on merit (tournament scenario) versus luck (random assignment). High-wage individuals in the merit-based setting exerted more effort and were more productive, although this did not lead to significant differences in efficiency.

It suggests that social capital, through community participation, influences preferences for redistribution due to psychological externalities such as envy towards the wealthy. The effect of social capital on redistribution preferences is more pronounced among the wealthy, indicating that frequent interaction within communities increases the negative externality caused by poorer individuals' envy, making the wealthy more inclined to support income redistribution."

Using qualitative interviews and scenario-driven vignettes, it finds that affluent individuals tend to individualize the causes of socio-economic positions, exhibiting a poor sociological imagination. In contrast, those experiencing deprivation more readily recognize structural determinants, employing a more developed sociological imagination. This divergence suggests that lived experiences significantly influence attitudes towards social policies, with potential implications for support for welfare and redistribution amidst rising structural inequality."
"ZSIS2GES","Other","BEL, DNK, DEU, FIN, FRA, NLD, NOR, ESP, SWE, CHE, GBR","ESS","2010","Survey","The study investigates the effect of subjective job insecurity and employability on preferences for redistribution in Western Europe, utilizing data from the European Social Survey. It finds that subjective job insecurity increases the demand for redistribution, especially among those with low employability perceptions. The analysis, based on workers from 11 Western European countries, underscores that the impact of job insecurity on preferences for redistribution is most pronounced among those fearing long-term unemployment. The study highlights the nuanced relationship between labor market dynamics and social policy preferences, advocating for a more detailed understanding of individual employment risks and their implications for welfare state support."

This is explained through the mechanisms of 'altruism' and 'appreciation.' High-income individuals show a shift in attitude towards favoring redistribution as austerity measures tighten, driven by increased visibility of income losses among others and a newfound appreciation for the welfare system. Overall, the study provides evidence that austerity can change political attitudes towards redistribution, highlighting the nuanced ways in which fiscal policies impact societal preferences."
"ZZDGMJIY","Redistribution","DEU","Other","2005","Survey","The article examines how individual preferences for redistribution in Germany are influenced by subjective expectations of occupational mobility utilizing data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). It finds that a significant chance of upward mobility decreases the demand for redistribution whereas a high risk of downward mobility increases it. This supports the prospect of upward mobility (POUM) hypothesis showing that expectations of future career progress significantly shape attitudes towards redistributive policies."
